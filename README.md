# üß† BIP ‚Äî AI-Powered Practice Exam Generator

BIP (*Before It's Printed*) is a machine learning-powered tool that generates custom practice exams based on uploaded exam files and user preferences. It is designed to be fast, modular, and progressively intelligent ‚Äî starting with OpenAI's GPT and transitioning to a fully self-hosted PyTorch model as usage data accumulates.

---

## üîç Problem Statement

I discovered that one of the most effective ways to study for exams is to **try to predict the exam questions** in advance and practice answering them. Even when the predicted questions aren't exact matches, they often turn out to be **very similar** to the actual exam ‚Äî making it excellent targeted practice.

This project is designed to bring that strategy to life through automation and AI.

## üéØ Project Goals:

- ‚úÖ Build a robust **file parser using FastAPI** and popular Python packages (`pdfplumber`, `python-docx`, `pytesseract`, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Integrate the system with my **existing Django server** and allow users to upload practice materials
- ‚úÖ Use **OpenAI's GPT API** initially to generate high-quality practice questions
- üîú Gradually transition to a **self-trained PyTorch model** for cost-efficient, offline question generation
- ‚úÖ Provide exam customization controls (length, difficulty, topic, format) for users

---

## üöÄ Features

- ‚úÖ Upload `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.png`, `.jpg`, `.webp`, or `.txt` exam files
- ‚úÖ Automatically extract questions using OCR and NLP preprocessing
- ‚úÖ Receive structured JSON output (question format, difficulty, type)
- üîú Generate high-quality exam questions using OpenAI's GPT API
- üîú Collect anonymized usage and feedback data for ML training
- üîú Fine-tune and self-host a PyTorch-based question generation model

## üß† Upcoming Components

### üîÆ OpenAI Integration (`/generate/` endpoint)

- Use OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-4o to:
  - Generate multiple-choice, short-answer, and development-style questions
  - Match exam style, topic, and difficulty based on uploaded content
- Configurable via frontend (topics, length, format, difficulty)
- Logged usage will build a dataset for later ML training

### üß† PyTorch NLP Trainer (Long-term self-hosted AI)

- Collect labeled data (prompt-response pairs, user feedback)
- Preprocess into training format (JSONL, Hugging Face Datasets)
- Fine-tune a base LLM (e.g. Phi-2, Mistral, LLaMA 3 8B) for question generation
- Train using PyTorch/Transformers + evaluate with BLEU/F1/etc.
- Deploy via ONNX or Hugging Face Inference stack
